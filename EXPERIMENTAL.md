This is a detached fork of lemmy server. Not to be confused with lemmy-ui or other front-end applications.

This project is experimental.

It is starting with the Lemmy server Rust codebase. Thank you to the Lemmy project.

## Epxectations

1. No claims are made to be able to replace Reddit or other traditioanl sites. Features are lacking and there are known performance problems with the SQL in the code.
2. There are known bugs realted to data integrity and consistency sharing data with peer servers.
3. The intention is to run a public forum with public content, public messages and comments. Data is shared over ActivePub federation with over 1000 other Lemmy servers and even non-Lemmy servers in the network.
4. Experimental may me broken code just for the sake of trying out new features or addressing some crash or design issue.
5. Nobody has hired or funded this project at start, it's just contribuiton of free labor currently, and please understand that it is encourged to seek out alternates as you wish. Part of being on the ActivePub federated network is to have choices.

The Wiki on GitHub has more about why this fork and the new website was created on August 24, 2023.

Thank you and may all men have a better future.
