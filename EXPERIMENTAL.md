This project is experimental.

It is starting with the Lemmy server Rust codebase. Thank you to the Lemmy project.

2. There are known bugs realted to data integrity and consistency sharing data with peer servers.
3. The intention is to run a public forum with public content, public messages and comments. Data is shared over ActivePub federation with over 1000 other Lemmy servers and even non-Lemmy servers in the network.
